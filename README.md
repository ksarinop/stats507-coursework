# stats507-coursework
This repository was created to showcase the learning and devolpment of my python programming throughout the course of STATS 507. 
Stats 507 surveys the software tools that are currently popular among data scientists in academia and industry. I am looking forward to share my progress and to learn things such as deep learning using PyTorch
